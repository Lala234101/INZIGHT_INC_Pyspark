# INZIGHT_INC_Pyspark

Inzicht Inc. is a Dutch market research and consulting firm that provides data-driven insights to businesses worldwide. They specialize in analyzing large datasets to identify market trends, customer behavior, and
competitive landscapes. I have been tasked by my client with analyzing a massive sales dataset containing 100,000 records of product sales across different global regions, countries, and sales channels
for the years 2010 through 2017. The dataset is provided in CSV format and is too large to be efficiently processed and analyzed using traditional tools like spreadsheets or single-machine Python libraries.
